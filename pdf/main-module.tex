\section{Module main}

    \label{main}
This is the main program. upon executing "python main.py" on the console, 
this program, reads the first line from the input file named 'input'. The 
first line must be the number of processes [nodes] in the network. This is 
needed to initialize the 2-D list of size n*n [n - number of nodes], which 
contains a mapping of links between different nodes. Next, ths control 
enters an infinite loop, in which the 'edge' information between two nodes 
is read, the control breaks out of the loop when an EOF is encountered in 
the file 'input'. the link information is stored in the 'edges' list. From 
here, the method getMPR is called , it exists in the olsr API file olsr.py.

sample input file ---

7

0,1

0,2

0,3

0,4

1,5

1,6

2,4

3,5

As we can see, the first line contains 7, which is the number of nodes in 
the network. the following lines after this give the information about the 
links between nodes. e.g. take 0,1 means that there is a link between node0
and node1.
