def setup(node\_id, addr, isMPR, mypeer):

    This method takes the arguments, 
    1. addr: The address to which the calling process binds itself to.
    2. isMPR: It is a boolean value. It is True when the calling process [node] is a Multi Point Relay of the source, else it is a two-hop neighbor or a one-hop neighbor which was not selected as an MPR of the source.
    3. node\_id: Unique Identifier of the calling process[node] a.k.a receiver
    4. mypeer: It is a list of one-hop neighbors of the calling process[node].
    
def source\_setup(node\_id, addr, MPRset, oneHop):

    This method takes the arguments,
    1. node\_id: Unique Identifier of the calling process[node] a.k.a receiver
    2. addr: The address to which the calling process binds itself to.
    3. MPRset: applicable only to the source node, its set of Multi Point relays.
    4. oneHop: applicable only to the source node, its set of one-hop neighbors who are not its Multi Point relays.

def startBroadcast(MPRset, i, allNeighbor):

    This method takes the arguments,
    1. MPRset: multi point relay set of the source node
    2. i: index of the node
    3. allNeighbor: It is a 2-D list, where each 1-D list in this 2-D list represents the one-hop neighbors of the on-hop neighbors of source node.
       e.g. allNeighbor[3] is a 1-D list of one-hop neighbor of the 4th[only in the list] one-hop neighbor of source.
